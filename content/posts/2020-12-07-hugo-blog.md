This blog is built on top of a [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) which statically renders all content. I have had no prior experience building anything using it but wanted to have a blogging platform available as soon as possible with as 
little friction as possible.

I have already worked with gatsby and next.js a bit as I am nowadays mostly working with React based frameworks, but I wanted to try something new :)

I've been following couple of tutorials and it all went quite smoothly. I don't want to duplicate HUGO's [Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) so I will just write down what went nicely and what went wrong.

## Setup

Generally following steps in Quick start allowed me to easily setup hugo development server and have a nice live-reload experience.

Once that was setup I had no troubles writing and creating new posts/pages and such. 
## Shortcodes

I've had started making my [About](/about) page and thought that it would be nice to have my name spelled there as it's usually something people struggle with when seeing it for the first time.

So I've had the need to add a custom html tag and possibly some code to it I didn't want to make it static in layout but just a component as I would do in react. A concept of shortcodes seemed to fullfill that need. It's basically a slice of code that you can inject into your content file without loosing the clarity of markdown. You can pass some arguments into it making it dynamic. You can read more at [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/)

To make your own custom shortcode you put it in `layout/shortcodes` and the file name will be how it's used in content I named mine *audio.html*

I've made a player that I wanted - an icon that plays sound {{< audio src="/hugo-blog-post/victory_tone_ff7.mp3" />}}

To insert it in content I had to type:

{{< highlight html>}}
({{</* audio src="/hugo-blog-post/victory_tone_ff7.mp3" */>}})
{{</ highlight>}}

Given short code:
{{< gist jaszczw 586b9d9e42e1cdb46b6ab5c630333876 >}}

You may notice strange formatting - I wanted the icon to be added without any additional spaces so that if you put it in brackets it's exactly there. I didn't want to modify external paragraph styles so I've did this formatting trick that removes any spaces from between elements.

I could easily make this more customizable with a passed content as the thing that plays the sound, but I am satisfied with result

## Opinion

The ease of use is nice, although after a couple of hours with HUGO I am not entirely sold. I really liked the included shortcodes that are almost like a build-in components.

The huge themes selection and idea of it just working is really neat. What I miss however from Gatsby or Next.js is ability to write custom components that are fully dynamic without having to fallback to pure javascript to handle everything. Maybe if I were to write more pure javascript once more it wouldn't be as much of an issue as I think, but I kind of have a hard time imagining building for example form with any kind of dynamic validation with the tools that I see at hand.

There is some drive in community to include things like svelte into the flow but as it stands it seems it's still a long way to go. [issue/poc-svelte](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/5894), [svelte-on-go](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/gscbxb/compiling_svelte_with_go/), [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/8).

If you have static website without need for more complicated dynamic components - hugo will do the trick - otherwise I would rather recommend something else.
